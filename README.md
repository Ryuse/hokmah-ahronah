# 🌌 Hokmah Ahronah

**Hokmah Ahronah** is an artificial vTuber/Chatbot created by **Ryuse** to assist **Noah Akrklight** in his journey to bring the last life in a dying universe into one that is abundant.

She bridges streaming tools, chat interactivity, and virtual character control into a single AI-driven companion for content creation.
